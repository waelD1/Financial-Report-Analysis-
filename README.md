# Financial Report Scrapping and Analysis
Scrapping of The Walt Disney Company's annual reports to perform financial analysis.

## Project details
I used <b> pdfminer.six </b> and <b>tabula</b> to scrape the pdfs and get the consolidated income statements.<br>
Then, I used Plotly in order to make some graphs allowing to observe the evolution of the total revenue, the costs as well as the evolution of the price of the Disney shares.
